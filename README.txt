Description:

A Tampermonkey Script to compile all of a person's answers into a
single document that can be easily searched or printed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Known Bugs:

  1) This script will double-count any answers that are mentioned in the
     notifications stream. 


  2) Answers that were originally given on merged questions won’t show 
     up in the compendium. 

Future Development:

  1) Turn the whitespace between answers into smooth page breaks.
